# OnClickListenerExample

This application shows how to pass adapter items into an activity using
interfaces. The sample data set contains two fields representing a pair of
Mathematical coordinates.

In the Logcat window, filtering the MainActivity tag, it can be seen the data
has been displayed on the log screen when an adapter item has clicked. The data
is displayed merely from the MainActivity. This magic happens when an interface
is built and implemented to both Adapter and MainActivity classes.
